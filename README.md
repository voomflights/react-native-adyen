## Getting started

### iOS

1. Install package with `$ npm install react-native-adyen-encrypt --save`
2. modify `ios/Podfile` so that `platform :ios` is >= 10
3. your iOS project will need to have a Swift bridging header. Easiest way to do this is to add a swift file to the project. This file must remain in the project ðŸ˜¢
4. Verify that your SWIFT_VERSION is >= 5
5. `pod install`
